/home/kmw/trees_ws/build/py_trees_ros_tutorials/setup.py:5: DeprecationWarning: The distutils package is deprecated and slated for removal in Python 3.12. Use setuptools or check PEP 632 for potential alternatives

/home/kmw/miniconda3/envs/ros2_py310/lib/python3.10/site-packages/_distutils_hack/__init__.py:15: UserWarning: Distutils was imported before Setuptools, but importing Setuptools also replaces the `distutils` module in `sys.modules`. This may lead to undesirable behaviors or errors. To avoid these issues, avoid using distutils directly, ensure that setuptools is installed in the traditional way (e.g. not an editable install), and/or make sure that setuptools is always imported before distutils.

Support for replacing an already imported distutils is deprecated. In the future, this condition will fail.
